# GTFS.Net
General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data parser

## Currently under construction

## Note
This is not a fork of [OsmSharp/GTFS](https://github.com/OsmSharp/GTFS). 
This project uses some part of that project (Entities) therefore not compatible

## To Do before releasing version 1
1. Implement EntityParserFactory
2. Return a facade object that holds object graph of parse files.
3. Implement a validator, which checks all the requirements
